### Layup Lines

This is a daily practice called Layup Lines. To access this:
- Fork/Clone this repo to your local machine
- Start a Jupyter Notebook server (from Terminal, type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter)
- Go through the notebook. If you need help with what commands are available, click on any cell, hit `Esc` and then `h`, which will bring up a dialog box
- `Shift` + `Enter` keys run the cell and execute code within
- `Option` + `Enter` keys run the cell and insert a new cell below
- To change the cell type: 
  - enter command mode by pressing `Esc`
  - your cell will turn blue
  - press the `Y` key to turn the cell into a code cell, and the `M` key to turn the cell into a markdown cell
